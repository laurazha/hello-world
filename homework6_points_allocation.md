Homework 6 (Systems homework 1)

total points: 30 points

program 1 (the bash script): 12 points
2 points for adhereing to the style guidelines posted on piazza. Don't be overly harsh,
         but please give feedback if you deduct as to which item in the style guideline that they failed to adhere to.
1 point for formatting the output correctly (should be as shown in the assignment, three lines,
        values for storage and memory separated with a "/" character
5 points if it works (1 point per output element, so 1 point for the core count, 1 point
         for free memory, 1 point for total memory, 1 point for free storage, 1 point for total storaged)
2 points for the program itself. Is it well structured, does the code make sense, is there
          unnecessary code? Again, be generous and comment as to why you deduct points.
1 point if the script is named correctly ("system_info.sh")
1 point if they have "#!/bin/bash" at the top of the script

program 2 (the C program): 18 points
3 points for adhereing to the style guidelines posted on piazza. Don't be overly harsh,
         but please give feedback if you deduct as to which item in the style guideline that they failed to adhere to.
4 points if it works, 1 point for each of the 3 outputs that is expected, 1 point if the program runs without crashing.
         NOTE: I realize that, depending on how the student reads the instructions, they may print the line with each
         word reversed in both the function and the main file. That's fine.kk
3 points if the code is structured as specified (with a main.c, replace.c, reverse_words.c and a Makefile). If they
         used header files, that is fine.
6 points for the program itself. 1 point for each of the two functions if they're structured reasonable,
         2 points for main if it's structured reasonably, 1 point if they used reasonable variable names,
         1 point for the Makefile.
1 point if the compiled binary has the correct name (program2)
1 point for free
