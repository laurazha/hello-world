Homework 6 (Systems homework 1)<br/>
<br/>
total points: 30 points<br/>
<br/>
program 1 (the bash script): 12 points<br/>
2 points for adhereing to the style guidelines posted on piazza. Don't be overly harsh,<br/>
         but please give feedback if you deduct as to which item in the style guideline that they failed to adhere to.<br/>
1 point for formatting the output correctly (should be as shown in the assignment, three lines,<br/>
        values for storage and memory separated with a "/" character<br/>
5 points if it works (1 point per output element, so 1 point for the core count, 1 point<br/>
         for free memory, 1 point for total memory, 1 point for free storage, 1 point for total storaged)<br/>
2 points for the program itself. Is it well structured, does the code make sense, is there<br/>
          unnecessary code? Again, be generous and comment as to why you deduct points.<br/>
1 point if the script is named correctly ("system_info.sh")<br/>
1 point if they have "#!/bin/bash" at the top of the script<br/>
<br/>
program 2 (the C program): 18 points<br/>
3 points for adhereing to the style guidelines posted on piazza. Don't be overly harsh,<br/>
         but please give feedback if you deduct as to which item in the style guideline that they failed to adhere to.<br/>
4 points if it works, 1 point for each of the 3 outputs that is expected, 1 point if the program runs without crashing.<br/>
         NOTE: I realize that, depending on how the student reads the instructions, they may print the line with each<br/>
         word reversed in both the function and the main file. That's fine.kk<br/>
3 points if the code is structured as specified (with a main.c, replace.c, reverse_words.c and a Makefile). If they<br/>
         used header files, that is fine.<br/>
6 points for the program itself. 1 point for each of the two functions if they're structured reasonable,<br/>
         2 points for main if it's structured reasonably, 1 point if they used reasonable variable names,<br/>
         1 point for the Makefile.<br/>
1 point if the compiled binary has the correct name (program2)<br/>
1 point for free
